Title: Longitudinal compositional data analysis via Generalized Estimating Equations

Description: The package contains functions for longitudinal compositional data analysis. The method is based on a multiplicative model by Firth and Sammut (2023) to represent data directly on the simplex, without logratio transformations. The longitudinal aspect is modeled via Generalized Estimating Equations (Liang and Zeger, 1986).
